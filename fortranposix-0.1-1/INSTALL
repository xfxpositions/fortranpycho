1. Edit the supplied Makefile if necessary.

2. Run make :
		gmake

3. This will generate a shared library : libfortranposix.so

4. Move this library to some place within your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

5. Read the file fortranposix_interfaces.f90 to learn about the usage of each function and to obtain the interface.

6. Append the -lfortranposix option to your linker. You may also need to specify an addition search path for library files (usually -L), depending upon your fortran compiler.

Enjoy !
