    I would strongly welcome bug reports, feature enhancement requests, compliments, donations and job offers :) My email address : msc@ieee.org

Thanks are due to the following :

* Tim Connors whose GPL'ed program bits.f90 was used as a (very) rough guide in writing one part (fortranpopen) of the library

* Every person who has helped me in my adventures with Fortran, from Fortran 77 to 90/95. Thanks are especially due to various denizens of comp.lang.fortran.

* Waheguru, of course !
